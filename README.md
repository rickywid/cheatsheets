## Cheatsheets

My personal cheatsheet for the various linux applications that I use. 

At the moment, I am currently running [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) on my main laptop and [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) on my secondary laptop. Some of these commands may or may not be specific to these linux distributions.
